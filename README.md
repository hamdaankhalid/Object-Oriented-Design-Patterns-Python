Design Patterns are well known solutions to recurring problems.
They are discovered not invented :)
Patterns are nlanguage neutral, I just chose to implement in python

- Creational Patterns: Used to create objects in  systematic way. Takes advantage of polymorphism.
- Behavioral Patterns: Best practices for objects interaction. Methods and signatures.
- Structural Patterns: Establish relationships bewteen components. Takes advantage of inheritance.

Note about Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows child classes to be instantiated and treated as same type as its parent.
